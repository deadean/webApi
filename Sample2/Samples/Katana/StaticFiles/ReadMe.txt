HelloWorld Sample
----------------------

Many web applications need to serve some static resources from files on disk
such as images or style sheets. Not all servers provide this functionality by 
default (e.g. self-host servers like HttpListener). This sample demonstrates how
to use the Microsoft.Owin.StaticFiles OWIN middleware tools to serve static files
on any OWIN server.
