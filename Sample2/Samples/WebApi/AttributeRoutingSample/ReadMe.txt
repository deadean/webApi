AttributeRoutingSample
----------------------

AttributeRouting is a great NuGet package provided by Tim McCall and friends 
which lets you specify routes, constraints, default values, and more using 
attributes directly on your API controllers and actions. This sample 
illustrates some of these features with ASP.NET Web API.

There are two NuGet packages depending on whether you use ASP.NET Web API with
self-host or with ASP.NET (this sample uses self-host):

http://nuget.org/packages/AttributeRouting.WebApi
http://nuget.org/packages/AttributeRouting.WebApi.Hosted

The source for AttributeRouting is available on github, see
