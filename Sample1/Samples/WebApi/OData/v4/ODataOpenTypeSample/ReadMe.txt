ODataOpenTypeSample
------------------

Entity or complex types which allow clients to persist additional undeclared properties are called open types. The additional undeclared properties are called dynamic properties.

This sample illustrates:

1. Build the edm model,
2. Add/update an open entity object with open a complex type property.
3. Query open entities.

It is a console application, just open the solution and hit F5 to run it.
